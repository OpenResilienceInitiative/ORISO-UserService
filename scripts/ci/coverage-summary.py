"""Renders JaCoCo line and branch coverage as a step-summary section.

The run summary already reports how many tests executed. It does not say how
much of the service those tests actually reach, so a shrinking covered share
stayed invisible between merges. JaCoCo already runs in the build; this turns
its CSV into the same table the summary shows for the suite inventory.

Coverage is measured over the unit suite only. The integration suite runs in a
separate job with its own execution data, so the figure here is a floor rather
than the whole picture.
